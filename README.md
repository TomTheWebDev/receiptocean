I made this website using html, css, phpMyAdmin and relational database.
The goal was to create a registration and log in system for the first time.
It has been a few months since the site was hosted, and i've learned alot since then and would use a different solution if faced with a similar project now.
I can now appreciate the use of components, ajax and spa technoligies that simplify the process and allow the site to run quickly.
